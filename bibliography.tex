% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
This document presents a bibliography of publications relating
directly or indirectly to the
Monopole and Exotics Detector at the LHC (MoEDAL).
%
It is intended to serve as a reference for members of the 
MoEDAL Collaboration,
students involved in research activities connected to MoEDAL,
and indeed anyone with an interest in the latest
searches for Dirac's hypothesised magnetic monopole at
CERN's Large Hadron Collider.
%
Both quick reference summary tables,
indexed by BibTeX citation code (as used in the
accompanying BibTeX file),
and a full bibliography in the BibTeX \texttt{unsrt} style
are provided.
%
Suggestions, comments, or additions from all
communities are welcome;
please contact the corresponding author
for more information.
